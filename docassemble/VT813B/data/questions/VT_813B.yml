question: |
  Is this tool right for you?
subquestion: | 
  ${ start_accordion('<h2 class="h5">Do you need this fee waiver form?</h2>') }
  <p>Before you begin, check to be sure you actually need to pay a court filing fee.</p>
  
  <p>When you ask the court for a Relief from Abuse (RFA) order, there are no court fees. It is free. Here is the full list of forms that have no filing fee:</p>
  
  <ul><li>Request for Relief from Abuse</li>
  <li>Request for Abuse Prevention for a Vulnerable Adult</li>
  <li>Request for Order Against Stalking</li>
  <li>Request for Order Against Sexual Assault</li>
  <li>Request for Extreme Risk Protection Order</li>
  <li>Abusive Litigation</li></ul>
  <p>You do not pay a fee to file an "answer" in a court case. However, there is a fee to file a "counterclaim" in some cases (such as eviction or small claims), but not others (such as divorce or parentage).</p>

  ${ next_accordion('<h2 class="h5">Who can get their fees waived?</h2>') }
  The Vermont Judiciary says the court can waive your filing fee and service costs if:
  
  <ul><li>you get any kind of public assistance, or</li>
  <li>your gross income is at or below <a href="https://www.vtlawhelp.org/150-federal-poverty-level-fpl">150% of the federal poverty guidelines,</a> or</li>
  <li>the court finds you can't pay the fee without expending resources needed to support you and your dependents.</li></ul>

  ${ next_accordion('<h2 class="h5">Information you will need</h2>') }
  <ul><li>the name and address of any employer you might have</li>
  <li>any public assistance that you get (like 3SquaresVT food help, ReachUp help for families, SSI, etc.) and the amount, and</li>
  <li>information about the court case for which you want a fee waiver. (You can find this information on other court papers you have about this case. If you are starting a court action — like filing for divorce — you won't have a case number or docket number yet.)</li></ul>
  
  <p>If you get public assistance, that's all you need. <strong>If you don't get public assistance</strong>, you will also need to know:</p>
  
  <ul><li>your income — If you work or get unemployment, have those paystubs on hand. If you get child support, have that information on hand. If you are self-employed, have your IRS Schedule C on hand or have your income and business expenses from the last 12 months.
  <li>your expenses (like rent, utilities, insurance payments, child care, etc.) — looking back over the last 12 months
  <li>the amount of money you have in the bank and on hand
  <li>the approximate value of your vehicle/car, real estate/home, and any other major things you might own, and
  <li>if filling out form on behalf of a minor or incompetent adult, you need that person’s information.</ul>
